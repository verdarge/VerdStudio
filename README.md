-----

The VERD Studio is an integrated development environment for VERD programming language. It allows a user to upload VERD project files, compile and run VERD projects, and debug them. Users can also search and replace in files within VERD Studio.

VERD Studio works with workspaces. A workspace is simply a collection of projects grouped together. In VERD Studio user can create new workspaces or add existing workspaces. In initial screen of VERD Studio user can choose from one of the workspaces that are previously added or created. 

VERD Studio keeps mainly three types of files to maintain its operations. First file that VERD Studio keeps is login file. Login file keep track of information such as workspace path and name about workspaces that are previously created or added.  Second file that VERD Studio keeps is workspace files. Workspace files are in XML format and include information about the projects such as project path, project name and breakpoints that projects have. Last file that VERD Studio keeps is project files. Each project in a workspace should have a project file. Project files are in XML format and include information about folder structure of project and files included in project. 

VERD Studio supports Unicode characters in workspace paths, folder paths, file paths and file names. VERD Studio requires all files including login, workspace, project and source code files to be encoded in UTF-8 format. VERD Studio also supports Unicode characters during searching and replacing source code files.

Source code files that VERD Studio uses should have the “.v” extension which indicates that source code file is VERD language source code file.
